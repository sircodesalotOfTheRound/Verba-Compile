Verbalize
=========

The `vblz` (Verbalize) tool compiles code down into lit-code for running within the vbos (VerbOS) execution environment.


> **NOTE on building verbalize:**
> (1) ensure that your **JAVA_HOME** environment variable is set to a version of Java 8. 
> You can verify this using `mvn -v` which should show you what version of maven you're currently using.
> (2) Download and `mvn install` <a href="https://github.com/sircodesalotOfTheRound/javaLinq">javaLinq</a>.
> (3) Download and `mvn install` Verbalize. You should be all set!
